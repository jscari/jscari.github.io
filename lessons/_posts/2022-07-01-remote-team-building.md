People are different. They did not join your team because their share the same hobbies with their coworkers but they share the same work.
Of course, you can create some fun sessions: random meetups, playing games, etc... But not everybody will participate or enjoy it.
The most generic team building will be work-related, create opportunities for your team to share their success and share ideas to improve (your process, your stack, your product), and let our human side do the rest.
Don't forget to make it so even the introverts will find space to participate.
