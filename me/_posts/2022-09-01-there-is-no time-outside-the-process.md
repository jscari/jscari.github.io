If you want to exercise correctly, pick some days and hours in your week and commit to them.
This is the same with your team, everything outside of the process, even if you recommend it, will not be done correctly.
Everything important for your team, product or business should be enforced.
Enforce code review, enforce QA, enforce translations, enforce lint, enforce estimations, etc...
Because your process will include all those steps, the necessary time will always be booked beforehand, and your team will have time to do it correctly.
