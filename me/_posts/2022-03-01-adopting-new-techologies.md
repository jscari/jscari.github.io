Your developers will usually push to use the latest technologies. Because the ones selling them say they are better, because when you try them in a small-scale side project you don't see all their cons, because working on those techs can help your developers' career, etc...
Never adopt a tech because others use it but because you need it.
Teach your developers that the final user does not care about the tech, they should enjoy first doing something for the user, not them.
Create opportunities so your team can work in some POC to try new tech and estimate its adoption cost. This will be fun and help everyone understand if you chose or not to use it.
