Everyone at home, you first, should understand that when your work remotely you are at work.
You are on time at work, you don't cook at work, you don't play video games at work, you don't call your SO at work, you don't have a bed at work, you are correctly equipped at work, etc.
You can and should also take some breaks at work and avoid working overtime.
