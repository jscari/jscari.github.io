Not every developer knows or admits where (s)he has to grow.
First things first, their weakness and goals should always be clarified.
Non-technical professional skills should not be overlooked and are usually the go-to for the youngest ones. 
Sometimes your business constraints will not allow any more growth (financial, technical, leadership,...). And this is fine, working in your team should be a journey and every journey has an end.
